# Demos

Demo applications illustrate common Dagger.jl usage patterns.

- `basic/`: reserved for lightweight tutorials and introductory notebooks.
- `advanced/`: complex patterns and algorithmic kernels (e.g., Barnes-Hut N-body).
- `real-world/`: end-to-end workloads powered by Dagger.jl (e.g., seam carving).

Each demo directory is a self-contained Julia project. Activate and instantiate before running the scripts inside.
