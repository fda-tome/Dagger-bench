# Barnes–Hut

Status: placeholder (no runnable app yet).

This folder is reserved for a Dagger.jl Barnes–Hut / N‑body application. Once implemented, it should contain a Julia project (`Project.toml`) and one or more runnable entry points.

The benchmark script (`benchmarks/scripts/barnes-hut.jl`) expects an app implementation to exist here, so it will remain non‑functional until the app is implemented.
