# Apps

Apps (Dagger.jl applications) live here.

Each app directory is intended to be a self-contained Julia project (with its own `Project.toml`/`Manifest.toml`), but at the moment this repo keeps **docs-only placeholders** under each app folder.

## Current apps

- `barnes-hut/`: Barnes–Hut N-body simulation.
- `seam-carving/`: Content-aware image resizing (seam carving).
