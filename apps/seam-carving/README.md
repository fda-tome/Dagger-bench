# Seam Carving

Status: placeholder (docs-only).

This folder will contain a Dagger.jl seam carving / content-aware resizing application.

## Expected contents

- Julia project: `Project.toml` (and optionally `Manifest.toml`)
- One or more runnable entrypoints (e.g. `par_seam.jl`, `seq_seam.jl`)
- Any app-specific docs and usage notes
